    <h1>Top 3 Amusing Websites</h1>
    <h3>by Damen Pape</h3>
    <p>The internet is a great place for amusement.  This page contains some of the websites I use for personal amusement.</p>

    <h2>#1 Amusement</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite places to go for amusement is Flowrestling. It is a site that has evrything wrestling which includes matches, rankings, and weekly podcasts.</p>

    <h2>Twitch</h2>
    <p>Twitch is a great place to find people streaming video games you might play.  This streaming service is a really good way to keep up with your favorite streamers and games.  For example my favorite streamer on Twitch is Jynxzi  </p>

    <h2>Youtube</h2>
    <p>Of course you can't leave out Youtube in websites that bring amusement. This is the page I go to when I am looking for something specific. Whether that is a certain wrestling match or video game, Youtube is the place I go to look up those things. Youtube has everything to offer from all the content creaters to reels and they even have movies.</p>
